# 🟩 Wordle Clone (React)

A personal project recreating the popular **Wordle** word-guessing game using **React.js**. This project was built to practice modern React fundamentals, state management, and UI feedback, and is deployed live on **Vercel**.

## 🎯 Features

* Classic Wordle-style gameplay
* 5-letter word guessing
* Limited number of attempts (6)
* Real-time letter feedback:

  * 🟩 Correct letter & correct position
  * 🟨 Correct letter, wrong position
  * ⬜ Letter not in the word
* Keyboard and on-screen input support
* Responsive UI for desktop and mobile

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js (JavaScript)
* **Styling:** CSS
* **Animation:** GSAP
* **Deployment:** Vercel


## 🚀 Live Demo

👉 **Live App:** https://wordle-jl7g.vercel.app
